## Ohms Law

- The relationship between the voltage across a resistor and the current through it is:
  V = iR
- We use the symbol **R** to represent resistance
- The unit of resistance is Ohms [O]

## Open Circuit

- Is a condition of discontinuity between two points
- The current across the open circuit is definitely zero
- The voltage across the open is not defined by the open circuit
- R = infinite for an open circuit

## Short Circuit

- Is a condition of perfect continuity between two points
- The voltage across the short circuit is definitely zero
- The current across the short is not defined by the short circuit
- R = 0 for a short circuit
