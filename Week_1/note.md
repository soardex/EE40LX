## Charge, Energy, and Potential

- We use the symbol **q** to represent charge quantity
- The unit of charge is Coulombs [C]
- **e** is the symbol for the charge on one electron
    e = -1.6 x 10 sup -19 [C]

## Current

- Current is the amount of flow of charge past a given point
- We use the symbol **i** to represent the current
- The unit of current is charge per unit time [C/sec], or Amperes [A]

## Voltage

- A charged entity placed in an electromagnetic field
- The unit of voltage is Volts [V]
- Voltage often denoted `V sub ab` to emphasize the fact that is the voltage difference between points a and b

## Kirchoffs Current Law

- The sum of currents entering a node must always be zero
- The sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of current exiting a node
- Applies to any closed surface, not just a node
- Common convention is to assign a positive `+` sign to a current if it is entering the node and a negative `-` sign if it is leaving it

## Kirchoffs Voltage Law

- The algebraic sum of the voltages around a closed loop must always be zero
- Add up the voltages in a systematic **clockwise** movement around the loop
- Assign a positive sign to the voltage across an element if the `+` side of the voltage is encountered first, and assign a negative sign `-` if the side is encountered first
